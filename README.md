#  Dress Code Detector using Computer Vision

##  Project Description

The Dress Code Detector is a smart monitoring and access control system built using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and YOLOv8 pretrained model. It captures live video using a webcam, detects whether the person follows proper dress code, and performs automated actions such as:

- Voice feedback
- Telegram alert notification
- LED indication
- CSV report generation
- Automatic door opening (optional)

##  Objectives

- Detect dress code compliance in real-time
- Automatically identify dress code violations
- Send Telegram notification for violations
- Provide instant voice feedback
- Maintain daily CSV report logs
- Control hardware components like LEDs and servo motor
  
##  Dress Code Rules
Girls:
- Long Kurthas

Boys:
- Formal Shirt
- Formal Pant

##  Features

### 1. Real-Time Detection
- Captures live video using USB webcam
- Uses YOLOv8 pretrained model for detection
- Processes frames using OpenCV
  
### 2. Telegram Alert System

When dress code violation is detected:

- Sends automatic message to Telegram channel
- Includes timestamp information

### 3. Daily Report Generation

The system creates and updates a CSV file automatically.

Report includes:
- Date
- Time
- Compliance Status

### 4. Voice Feedback System

Provides instant audio feedback using Bluetooth speaker.

Compliance:
```
Thank you, you may enter
```

Non-compliance:
```
Please follow proper dress code
```
